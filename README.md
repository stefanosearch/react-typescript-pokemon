# React and Typescript

This project has as its main aim just report my first experience using Typescript and React together and it is by no means a source of Typescript reference itself.

You can read about my experience in the dev.to article I wrote [React + Typescript === "headache](https://dev.to/vinicius77/react-typescript-headache-424g) where I related it step-by-step.

The most important file is the <code>PokemonSearch.tsx</code> but I kept the old ones so people can notice the changes I have made along the way.
